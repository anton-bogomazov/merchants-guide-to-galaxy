# Setup modular application with acceptable DX.

## Context and Problem Statement
Application should be set up and configured in a some way.

## Decision Drivers

* DX is one of the most important things.
* Anyone hates to be distracted on technical inconveniences in the heat of the work.
* Application should be easy to use without any complex manual local set up on each new machine.

## Decision Outcome

* Add linter, static and coverage analyzer.
* Driving Gradle with scripts.
* Preconfigure test scope.

### Positive Consequences

* Impossible to push broken application (which impossible to build or with failing tests).
* Consistent codebase and some basic numbers from reports.
* Reports with numbers.
* Saved time on remembering the right Gradle command.
* Safe and easy to write test.
* Simpler configuration of submodules.

### Negative Consequences

* Configuration in a few places.
* Complex root configuration.
