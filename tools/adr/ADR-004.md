# Domain Factory Method convention

## Context and Problem Statement
Let's admit that my domain static factory method's naming is just random.
Find convention and follow it in the code.

## Decision Drivers

* I want to have an expressive and predictable API for creating domain objects

## Solution
Java uses the following convention:
- from - A type-conversion function that takes a single parameter and returns a corresponding instance of the same type.
- of - An aggregation function that takes multiple parameters and returns an instance of the same type that incorporates them.

Most of my factories perform type-conversion, so I have to use 'from'

Also I have UnitPrice and Credits objects which perform calculations based on factory method parameters. 
I like expressiveness of Credits' total method, so I pick 'calculate' for UnitPrice instantiation.

## Access to Static Factory Methods
I want to defense system from invalid instances of domain entities as much as possible so I restrict access to its constructors.

Public Static Factory Method is the only way to construct domain entity.

PROBLEM: kotlin data classes expose copy() method to public and I can't override it to restrict.
