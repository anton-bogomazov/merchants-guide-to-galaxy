## Context and Problem Statement
Let's admit that my domain static factory method's naming is just random.
Find convention and follow it in the code.

## Decision Drivers

* I want to have an expressive and predictable API for creating domain objects

from - A type-conversion function that takes a single parameter and returns a corresponding instance of the same type.
of - An aggregation function that takes multiple parameters and returns an instance of the same type that incorporates them.

Most of my factories perform type-conversion, so I have to use 'from'

Also I have UnitPrice and Credits objects which perform calculations based on factory method parameters 
I like expressiveness of Credits' total method, so I pick 'calculate' for UnitPrice instantiation.


private constructors
