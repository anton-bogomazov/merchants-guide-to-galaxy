# CLI

## Context and Problem Statement
I don't know how to parse, extract arguments and run commands

## Structure

Application - DI and lifecycle management of dependencies
Application Shell - endless loop for command handling and running
Command - supertype of usecase runner/result processor
Extractor - component, that matches and extracts arguments from command line to create CommandArguments
CommandArguments - layer of converters to encapsulate validation handling

### Command
Sealed interface with a single 'execute' method
Responsibility: run use case and handle its execution result (convert results to string for cli)

To run usecase, Command should have all necessary data and injected usecase.
I want to store data as class properties and inject usecase to method to increase cohesion: 
usecase will be referenced only once in a single 'execute' method, but properties multiple (passing to usecase, constructing 
result or error strings)
