# Application construction and Dependency Injection

## Context and Problem Statement
Most of the components depend on abstraction. Concrete instances have to be constructed and injected somewhere.

## Decision Drivers
- DI should be done as close to the app entry point as possible.
- Application should be possible to configure using external configuration.
- Solution should not require configuration and construct 'default' app.

## Solution
- Implemented Pure DI: ApplicationFactory and StorageConfiguration are used to instantiate and inject every app component.
- Configuration with properties: ApplicationProperties reads and processes property sources.
- External configuration is optional: if it isn't provided fall back to standard CLI and InMemory storage.
